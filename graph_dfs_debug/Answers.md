Describe the fixes/improvements you made to the Graph implementation here.

1- Edges 
corrected self.vertices to include both start and end
2- Variables
changed variables to be descriptive
3- DFS
refactored to move helper inside main function, changed visited set to dict
4- Components
changes components to be list, rather than integer.  I couldn't figure out what you were trying to do with that
5- Replaced most of your functions with mine from my pair project.  I would like to go back and use your code, if time allows.
